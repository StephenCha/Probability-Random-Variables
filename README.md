# Relationships-between-probability-variables

Random variables are associated with each other. An example of a binary event was created and the Probability Mass Function of Bernoulli Random Variable was defined. Using the example defined earlier, I implemented a simulation program that evolved into four different RVs.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* matplotlib
* numpy
* math
* sympy

## Try Code!
``` zsh
# In zsh (your terminal)
python Random_Varables.py
```  

## Results
### Bernoulli Distribution Stem Plot

If the probability is 0.35, then the sample space S becomes S = {0, 1}

$$
\textbf{Binomial PMF} = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
